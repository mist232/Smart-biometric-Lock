# Smart-biometric-Lock
This project was made in my second year of college during covid -19 pandemic.
It employs the technology of Internet of Things where only authorized users are granted acess instead of a fingerprint scanner the client can use his/her mobile phone's fingerprint scanner, and the access logs are also shown to the administrator. the main purpose of this project was to reduce human contact during pandemic and ensure security of the persons because traditional biometric systems which are used for attendance and door locks in colleges or workplaces were of no use during covid 19 pandemic.


It makes use of NODEMCU microcontroller, relay module and a power source.


Firstly the database is made usng firebase which stores each user's fingerprint template along with the photo of person for double authentication and then the user can login through the application and punch his/her fingerprint for marking attendance or unlocking door locks. Further more we can make use of GI tags and link the API with the application where it can send user's data along with the time and location. This ensures that the person requesting access is in the perimeter area.
